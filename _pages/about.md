I'm **Yang Shan** (CN name: **杨杉**), a third-year undergraduate student majoring in **Software Engineering** at the **School of Information and Software Engineering**, **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China**(UESTC). 

I was advised by [Prof. Rao](http://www.raoyunbo.cn/) from [School of Information and Software Engineering](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/) at UESTC,conducting research on medical image segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis.I am currently working in [Prof. Lian'lab](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/zlian/) from [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University，where I am focusing on font style transfer and generative models.

My interesting research areas include:
- **Computer Vision**
- **Medical image analysis**  
- **MLLMs**  
- And more...
